### Important information on the usage of Painful Conditions and Constipation codelists

#### Painful Conditions
After discussion, the clinicians were worried that people who had received 5 or more prescriptions for an acute pain event (e.g. following an accident) would be classified as having a chronic pain condition. We, therefore, decided to adjust the Prodcode codelist implementation as follows:
1.	5 or more prescriptions of prodcodes in a 12 month period.
2.	The length of time between the first and last prescription in the 12 month period should be >6 months. (This aligns with the definition of a chronic condition being one that lasts > 6 months).

There are two codelists to identify Painful Conditions:
1. [MULTIPLY_Prodcode_painful_conditions_analgesic.csv](https://github.com/f-eto/MULTIPLY-Initiative/blob/main/MULTIPLY_Prodcode_CPRD_GOLD/long-term-conditions/MULTIPLY_Prodcode_painful_conditions_analgesic.csv): Analgesics excluding migraine treatments
2. [MULTIPLY_Prodcode_painful_conditions_epilepsy.csv](https://github.com/f-eto/MULTIPLY-Initiative/blob/main/MULTIPLY_Prodcode_CPRD_GOLD/long-term-conditions/MULTIPLY_Prodcode_painful_conditions_epilepsy.csv): Epilepsy drugs excluding benzodiazepenes 

*Codelists implementation: 5 or more analgesics prescriptions in last 12 months in the absence of an Epilepsy diagnostic code ever recorded.*

#### Constipation
After discussion, the clinicians were worried that people who had received 5 or more prescriptions for an acute episode of constipation would be classified as having a chronic constipation. We, therefore, decided to adjust the [Prodcode codelist](https://github.com/f-eto/MULTIPLY-Initiative/blob/main/MULTIPLY_Prodcode_CPRD_GOLD/long-term-conditions/MULTIPLY_Prodcode_constipation.csv) implementation as follows:
1.	5 or more prescriptions of prodcodes in a 12 month period.
2.	The length of time between the first and last prescription in the 12 month period should be >6 months. (This aligns with the definition of a chronic condition being one that lasts > 6 months).

To identify Painful conditions and Constipation we used the codelists (medication codes) developed by Payne and colleagues and published on an online repository [1]. Those codelists and their implementation were revised by our research team.

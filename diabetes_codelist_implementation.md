### Important information on the usage of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Unspecified/Rare Diabetes codelists

After clinical discussion, we decided to apply the following algorithms to correct disease classification in patients who received different combinations of diagnostic codes for Diabetes over time:

1. If a patient who received an Unspecified/Rare Diabetes diagnostic code has ever been also recorded with either T1D or T2D, then the specific diagnostic code should prevail over the unspecific one.
2. Patients who received both T1D and T2D diagnostic codes over time should be classified with Unspecified/Rare Diabetes.
